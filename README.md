# Github-Mobile
Application built with React, Redux, data powered by github,

I will launch this project when there is not too many bugs, and move the backend part to **another private repo**.

### Something you need to know

+ `webpack@2.0.0` instead of `1.0.0`
+ `react-router-dom` instead of `react-router@4.0.0`
+ `redux-saga` instead of `redux-thunk` or `redux-promise`
+ Chrome `Redux DevTool` extension instead of `redux-dev-tool` kit
+ `antd` in use
+ generator & async,await & decorator supported
+ `github` to authenticate and get some info
+ `express` based server
+ `cheerio` providing some info only from the pages
+ `paths-js` to build the path of charts
+ `react-intl` for i18n

### Some Help I Need
+ `syntaxhighlighter` doesn't work on windows 10, built package in need
+ code detection is needed for the codes
+ It's really hard to draw the path smoothly, is there any blog or book helps?

*there might be a pocket edition written in `Vue.js` some day ~*
