# Github-Mobile
Application built with React, Redux, data powered by github,

I will launch this project when there is not too many bugs, and move the backend part to **another private repo**.

+ `antd` in use

*There are so many pages to work at, you can just take a look of it*

### Some Help I Need
+ `syntaxhighlighter` doesn't work on windows 10, built package in need
+ code detection is needed for the codes
+ It's really hard to draw the path smoothly, is there any blog or book helps?

*there might be a pocket edition written in `Vue.js` some day ~*
